Hi there!

My name is Mehdy Khoshnoody. I am a python developer. 
I mostly build web APIs using flask micro-framework.
and I usually use PostgreSQL as primary database, 
redis for caching and temporary data storage, and Elasticsearch as my search engine.

I am almost interested in every technology I know :D

but if I want to mention some bold ones I can say that I mostly study python and follow it's community, activities and technologies around it.

Then I really like golang and I usually study something about it and totally I'm trying to use golang as my primary language.

I also like erlang and rustlang so much but I'm not really into following them up. I just read something about them sometimes.

And as you're walking in the world of web you need to know javascript to survive :))

I'm so interested in Artificial Intelligence(AI). I've tried to do some cool stuff with Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Computer Vision(CV).

I really like cloud computing and big data stuffs and I try to get involved with it more. I use openstack by the way :)

I use Arch linux, vim, zsh and ...
