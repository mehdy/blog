Hey hey!

It’s been almost two years since my last post on this newsletter. A LOT has happened since then and I’m not even gonna try recapping it. Let’s just dive into what I’m going to do now :)

## Reboot as Fearless

"Fear" has been my one and only true enemy in life. Every day I'm trying to do/build something and fight the fear of failure and judgment. I’ve decided to write about these stories and share my journey with you. As you probably know the topics I’m super interested in are software engineering, startups, leadership, business, and Investment.

I want to send out a new post every week on Monday at 21:00. There are few sections I like to have it on every post:

- Book Clubs (Updates on books I read)
- Investment (Updates on my portfolio development and financial news)
- Startups

Let’s start with this week’s stuff!

Oh! And let me know if you want to help me in doing this newsletter. Any ideas or suggestions are welcomed :)

## Book Clubs

Throughout the years I’ve been a part of a bunch of book clubs. They all have been great and valuable but for some reason, they all have faded away after a while.

So recently I’ve started doing something new. Every time I want to pick up a new book I call for forming a book club just for that specific book. It’s been great so far. You get to meet new people and insight. Everyone in the club is invested in reading that book.

The next book I want to read is [“The Intelligent Investor”](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106835.The_Intelligent_Investor) by Benjamin Graham. It’s an old (but gold) book about investing in the stock market. If you’re interested in being in the book club for this book, let me know. And hey, let me know if you’re okay with me recording the sessions and uploading it to YouTube.

I believe book clubs are valuable when everyone gets the chance to share their insight so there are limited spots (~10 people). If you want in you need to let me know soon.

The sessions will probably start after the new year though.

## Investment

In this section I will update you with my last week’s portfolio development. Discuss important news and ideas around stocks and investment in general.

Last week my portfolio underperformed all three indices I keep track of. As far as I know, nothing important happened; it was just the market being the market. So I’m not making changes to the portfolio.

Let me know if there’s something you want me to add to this section.

## Startups

I’m obsessed with startups! Recently, I’ve started a new company to build the next generation of Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). I’m super excited about this BUT I’ll keep you updated on this later on.

For now, I wanna share that I’ve become much more active and if you have an idea you want to discuss or if think I could help you in any way, don’t hesitate to contact me! We can schedule a meeting and see if we can do something together.

## Random Photo

Recently, I’ve bought a new camera (Sony ZV-E10) to hopefully create some YouTube videos. Anyway, on my last trip to Málaga, Spain, I tried photography with a real camera for the first time took a ton of photos (It’s a really nice hobby). I like this particular photo a lot :)
