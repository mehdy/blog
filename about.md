Hi there!

My name is Mehdy Khoshnoody. I am a python developer. 
I mostly build web APIs using flask micro-framework.
and I usually use PostgreSQL as primary database, redis for caching and temporary data storage, and Elasticsearch as my search engine.

I am also interested in many other technologies(languages, databases and etc) like 
golang, erlang, rustlang, javascript, noSQL databases (cassandra, neo4j, mongo, ...), Artificial Intelligence(AI), Natural Language Processing(NLP), Computer Vision(CV), Linux, cloud computing, OpenStack, big data and almost every new technology :D
