Hi!

As you know Iâ€™m very new to publishing this newsletter. Iâ€™ve been posting content recommendations on my [Telegram channel](https://t.me/mehdyK), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mehdy314), [Mastodon](https://hackyderm.io/@mehdy), and, [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mehdy314) and I was planning on republishing mostly each weekâ€™s content as an issue for this newsletter.

Iâ€™m not still sure whether itâ€™s a good idea or not. Iâ€™m thinking about it and Iâ€™ll keep you posted as well. Meanwhile, Iâ€™d be happy to get your advice. What do you think?

## Layoffs & Global Economy

Joma explains the heavy layoffs in tech and why the global economy is shit right now. Probably not the most accurate one but definitely a very fun and straightforward one.

## About WHY

After reading [Start With WHY](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8131906-start-with-why), Simon Sinekâ€™s first book, I was very excited about the idea. This is [my review of the book on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2173054925):

> It was a great read. At first, I was a little skeptical about the claims and wasn't happy to see that there was no scientific research and data about the theory. It's primarily based on the author's claim. But then as I read more I "felt" that it was probably right. I think that it's important to consider this while reading the book. The theory claims that the WHY is not something we humans could "talk" about because it's not in the same part of the brain that controls language. So it might be wise to not expect the same scientific structure to approach a problem that may not respond well to the scientific approach.

So I started reading "Find Your Why" and early on this quote hit me hard!

## Intuitions & Empathy

I have always liked intuitions and I mostly remember good experiences from relying on my intuition. But I've also feared coming off as irrational and not being data-driven.

As mentioned in [the essay](https://medium.com/the-cloud-architect/skills-that-make-a-big-difference-569bfb81c4bc), there's always the trap of biases, but it should not hold us back to rely on intuition as well.

Make sure to read the next part about "[Empathy](https://medium.com/the-cloud-architect/skills-that-make-a-big-difference-a68d316b5954)" as well.

## Have Fun in PR

I stumbled upon [this PR](https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/9687) of the docker/compose project and found out they have a very fun and cute idea to ask for a cute animal picture on each PR. ðŸ˜»

## Let Me Be Your Copilot ðŸ¥¸

## Dev Tool Startup

[Consoleâ€™s S02E05](https://console.dev/podcast/s02e05-devtools-investing-ed-sim-boldstart/) was such an amazing episode! [Ed Sim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edsim/), a dev tools investor, shares his insight and experiences about starting a dev tool startup. Interesting advice for developers who are thinking about creating a new dev tool whether they're looking for making a few extra bucks or not!

## Architecture: Reasoning or Rules

[These](https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/investing-wisely-in-architecture-through-refactoring) are very good points. Architecture is supposed to be about thinking and reasoning but yet we often forget about the core idea and we stick to the rules of dos and don'ts.

## Can You Solve This?

I wrote a [very small blog post](https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/investing-wisely-in-architecture-through-refactoring) last week explaining a problem I noticed while I was riding the bus. Itâ€™s fun problem to think about if youâ€™ve got the time.

## What are the chances?

Iâ€™ve been a hard-core fan of Veritasium for a very long time now. I watch every new video and Iâ€™d recommend all of them. If you havenâ€™t seen it yet try this video from last week.

## A niche: The Kidsâ€™ App Market

Have you ever thought about the kids' app market?

It's interesting to read [what's happening in this market](https://www.bjornjeffery.com/2019/05/31/the-kids-app-market-a-strategic-overview/) and what could be done. There are always many opportunities to solve a problem and make a business out of it.

It's incredible to see how people share their most valuable experiences generously. You just have to listen carefully to find out about them.

Make sure to read all three parts.

## Thank You

WOW! I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™ve written this much since last week :) If youâ€™ve come this far, I thank you very much and Iâ€™d like to know what you think of this issue.
