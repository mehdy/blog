Writing is hard. But I’ve always enjoyed it as well, despite all the frustrations. It helps to think better. I’ve recently read this great blog post ([Writing is Magic](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2022/11/08/writing.html)) and I couldn’t agree more with it.

> *Writing is nature’s way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is.*

## Why this, why now?

As I said I enjoy writing and I’ve always wanted to have a newsletter but I never had the courage and the confidence that I’ll have enough content for the next week or event the next month. Recently it seems that I’m getting more consistent in reading a few articles every day and writing about those that I really like on my [Telegram channel](https://t.me/mehdyk).

I have an automation set up to post every message to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mehdy314) as well but I think a weekly newsletter would be much better if I could continue this routine.

## What will it be about?

As I’ve grown and gained diverse experiences throughout my career I’ve come to the realization that I enjoy three topics the most: **Software Engineering**, **Startups**, and **Leadership**.

So this newsletter would be a compilation of the content I’ve consumed in the past week or maybe even before which it’ll most likely be on those topics.

I’ll try my best to include a diverse set of content from blog posts to podcasts, videos, and more(!?) each week.

I would also add my opinion or a recent learning experience if I had one. :)

## Learn with me

As I explained the newsletter would shadow my learning process and I would love to have you among other like-minded subscribers to share my journey with you.
