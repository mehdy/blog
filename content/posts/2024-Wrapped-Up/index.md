Hi,

I know, I know! Everyone’s doing “wrapped up”s, and it's getting cheesy, but I will do it anyway. It’s fun, and I really enjoy reflecting on the past and setting goals for the next year.

But before that, I invite you to watch this amazing interview with Sam Altman.

## Books

Let’s start with books. I had a goal to read 15 books but I only read 10. Here you can see more about [my *year* in Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/33466886).

The two books that I enjoyed most were “[No Rules Rules](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49195924-no-rules-rules)” and “[The Coaching Habit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29342515-the-coaching-habit)”.

> An entrepreneur's must-read!
I'm sure that in reality, it's not as perfect as the book illustrates BUT regardless, I believe this is an excellent starting point to learn how to operate an innovative company.
To me, the most important part is the "Freedom & Responsibility" idea. It's a very simple one. It works! But it's super hard to implement. It's tough to convince yourself to trust others that you know they're smart to do things as they think fit. Just focus on getting crazy-smart people together, give them the right context and just let the magic begin! — [Mehdi K.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3562405588)

> Very concise and clear about what is an effective coaching dynamic and how to make it happen. Acknowledging the pitfalls and issues you'd probably face while trying coaching and explaining how to overcome them and why it's important to do so is something the book is doing perfectly. — [Mehdi K.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4022650934)

And hey, I do some [ad-hoc book clubs](https://mehdy314.substack.com/i/153134058/book-clubs) so if you’re interested let me know.

## Movies & TV Series

I love consuming stories! It’s one of my favorite hobbies. In 2024 I watched a lot of movies and TV series. These are the best ones.

Every year, I write down some goals and desires for myself. Here are a few for next year.

- I think it’s time to learn some Swedish. I hope to be able to have basic conversations in Swedish by EOY.
- Increasing my total net worth by ~50%
- Reading 15 books
- Keep doing this newsletter every week!
- Doing some YouTube videos

Fear NOT,
Mehdi K.
